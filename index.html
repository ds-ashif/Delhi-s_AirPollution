			<h2>Air Pollution </h2>
			<p>Air pollution is a serious problem affecting our environment and human health. We are dedicated to
				providing you with information on the causes of air pollution and what you can do to prevent it.
				Air pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the air that we breathe. These substances can be in the form of gases, particles, or biological molecules and can have serious negative impacts on human health, the environment, and climate.

				The sources of air pollution can be both natural and human-made. Natural sources include wildfires, dust storms, and volcanic eruptions. However, human-made sources are the major contributors to air pollution, including emissions from transportation, industry, power generation, and agriculture.

				<h3>Delhi's air pollution causes health problems</h3>
				<p>NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Wednesday revoked the ban on diesel
					generator sets in Delhi-NCR as the air quality in the capital is expected to remain in the moderate
					category for the next few days.
					The overall air quality index (AQI) was 164. In the wake of the improvement in air quality due to
					strong surface winds, the commission lifted Stage II measures under Graded Response Action Plan
					(GRAP).
					As the intensity of the air pollution increases in the national capital, Delhiites are yet again back to breathing in the notorious PM 2.5— a lung cancer-causing pollutant. Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) is in a severe category and the concentration of PM 2.5 is spiking to emergency levels.

In Delhi PM 2.5 is nearly 100 times the safe limit set by World Health Organisation and long-term exposure to it can cause severe respiratory ailments, or even lead to fatal lung cancer.

				<h3>How punjab and Haryana are responsible for Delhi's Air Pollution ?</h3>
				<p>Punjab and Haryana are major agricultural states in India that contribute significantly to Delhi's air pollution through a phenomenon known as stubble burning. Stubble burning is the practice of burning crop residue after the harvest season to clear the fields quickly for the next crop. This burning releases a significant amount of pollutants into the atmosphere, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds.

					The smoke and pollutants released from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana get carried by winds to Delhi, where they combine with the city's own pollution, exacerbating the problem of air pollution in Delhi. This is particularly severe during the winter months, when atmospheric conditions trap pollutants close to the ground, leading to a thick blanket of smog that can have serious health consequences.
					
					In addition to stubble burning, other factors that contribute to Delhi's air pollution include vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, and construction dust. However, stubble burning is a major contributor, and efforts are being made to address this issue through policies aimed at reducing the practice and promoting alternative uses for crop residue.

				<h3>Role of Delhi government to reduce Delhi's air pollution:</h3>
				<p>The AAP government has taken several steps to reduce pollution in the national capital, the chief minister said.

					“We introduced the Electric Vehicle Policy in 2020 and electric vehicle sales are the highest in Delhi. We have procured several new buses and, by 2025, 80% of Delhi's bus fleet will be electric. We have a tree transplantation policy and Delhi's tree cover has risen to 23.6% higher than the national average of 20%,” he said.
					The introduction of CNG vehicles, use of catalytic converters, use of lead-free petrol having lower sulfur content, phasing out the old vehicles and most recently, "odd -even" scheme for use of petrol and diesel vehicles are some of the major steps taken to reduce pollution in Delhi. Despite these steps, Delhi's atmosphere is still highly polluted with suspended particulate matter.
